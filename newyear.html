          <p class="letter-paragraph">You don't know how full my heart feels just knowing you're with me through everything. Your presence alone changes my world. I still remember how happy I was celebrating my first birthday with you — something I had dreamed of since I was in 7th grade. I waited, without even knowing I was waiting… and then you came into my life and made everything make sense.</p>
          
          <p class="letter-paragraph">This is our second New Year together — 2026 — and even that feels unreal to me. Time moves, years change, but the way you make me feel stays constant. There are moments when I try to put my love for you into words, and I realize there are none strong enough. All I can do is melt, every single second, thinking of you… of my everything.</p>
